# 4 Words :  Narrative, Mechanics As Metaphor, Dynamics, Aesthetics

4 Words

- Narrative - elements in a game that shows something and conveys a narrative, through character, the world and the mechanics
  - Linear - following, A to Z, minimal branching, too many AAA Games are like that 
  - Branching - choices
- Mechanics As Metaphor - rules and system in a game that affects your experience and makes game possible
- Dynamics - how it feels to play, the experience, how you felt 
  - E.g One And One Story
    - it made me tensed because she is about to die...
    - Being in a relationship with someone suicidal. Don't have contro over her
    - Stable relationship, but could easily collapse
    - Maybe each time you restart, the previous couple relation failed, and you move to another couple 
    - Stalker vibe.
    - Easter egg, go against expectation, in the opposite direction, - Joy in something unexpected
    - Game Sense - attitude, choice points
      - Going to the left , new unexpected route
      - Going to the right, expected route
- Aesthetics - a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty, especially in art.

- Mechanics As Narrative

  - Convey Emotions
  - Engaging with mechanics end up performing narrative
    - Makes you feel like you are part of the story

  

- One and One Story

  - Tutorial - Really important, talk to you the way it functions
  - Narrative Genre
  - Gameplay Style
    - Platformers
    - Puzzle
    - Single Player Coop
    - Romance "Must have obstacles that keep the couple alone"
  - Mechanics 
    - Swapping out characters "Z or C, think of her"
    - Limits
      - Can't jump
      - Girl will chase after you sight, and get killed by spike if you don't push boxes to block her from obstacles
    - Pushing boxes "I really love pushing boxes"
  - Narrative
    - Representation/Epitome/Symbolism
      - Spikes 
        - Overcoming obstacle "She really loves jumping over spikes" -> Problems/situation that you can't get over that splits you apart
      - Characters Touch each other to win
        - show that you've won by the heart symbol
        - Signify completion
        - mechanics - must use both of the lovers
      - Accidental Killing
        - Squash your lover by pushing the boxes and let it fall on them accidentally
      - Male Focused
        - despair - heavy lifting in one character
        - "Without her, I feel like a heavy rock", male can't jump, so female has to do all the work
          - "Trust me, I won't hurt you, not anymore, my dear love" - I could be the girl or the boy "
            - If you ignore this text, and go the opposite way, an easter egg will be triggered, and you and the girl be falling forever in the main menu as you walk out of the screen
              - Interpretation : Girl can't live on without the boy, so she jumped off and killed herself too. Boy would rather jump off a cliff than to see his girl
      - Female 
        - Invisible Labour
        - cShe is going to walk "And she was running away"
          - Save her by dropping box in time before she walks to the spike
          - When you have a timer element, gameplay really changes
      - Progression
        - Next Level is like a new chapter of a play or a novel
          - "Then we walked together"
            - If you move left, she moves left
        - Same architecture of level often repeats
          - But rules change, different rule sets
          - In other words, Create unique levels, Keep everything the same, except one thing
          - Leads to different gameplay, and emotions invoked, and replayability loop
        - Controlling multiple characters at once
          - Safe for you, but unsafe for others
          - Boy jumping over box may mean girl jumping to a spike 
        - Ending
          - 
      - Notes
        - There are many ways that Gameplay mechanic and narrative do the story
        - Every person may interpret narrative differently, there are many ways for narrative to be interpreted

Game Mechanics as a metaphor

- Mechanics
  - Rules and systems
    - That makes gameplay possible
    - That affects your experience.
      - Music
      - Art Design
      - Atmosphere
    - how you play (strategy)
      - Control Scheme
    - Vocabulary
      - Def. Content in a game.
    - Grammar of play
      - Def. pay attention to what a game looks like or the world.
      - E.g Fogs gives a sense of environment that makes you want to go
        somewhere where you can’t see
  - As metaphor
    - Influence story
    - Enact emotion
      - Create a sense of feeling that you are there in the game
        experiencing all these things
- Relationship
- Connections
- Emotion
- Gives characters backstory even if its not real
      
  - E.g Wolfenstein, you kill soldiers who might have a family who
            mourn for their death, or zombies who may have lived a happy
            live or something as a human before
- Psychology of games
  - Humans interpret scenes differently
    - You can tell this so much backstory with just abstractive less
          realistic graphics
    - E.g Ikea Ad Lamp video where the lamp is dumped and replaced
          with a new one, and it is filmed like a child that is going to
          be abandoned to the street by its mother like an orphan
      - Scene Sequence
        - Owner turns off lamp and takes it away
        - Lamp stares at its original home room
        - Lamp abandoned outside home
        - Lamp stood under rain
        - The sad music
        - The rain
        - Stared at the room, the owner replaced you with a new
              lamp.
        - Climax
        - Random guy shows up and tells you why do you resonate
              with the lamp, it has no feelings at all and no
              emotions.
      - Audience
        - Assign personalities to inanimate objects
        - Bring inanimate objects to life by giving them
              characteristics
        - Devices – personification , anthropomorphism ,animism
    - E.g Heider & Simmel demonstration psychology study, where a
          block is depicted to chase a ball into a cube, and then another
          block goes to protect the ball by engaging the aggressive block
      - Interpretation
        - Store a box in a box
        - Depicts abusive relationship
        - Depicts theft
        - Sense of dramatic situation of confluct
        - Depicts running off
      - How people react/interpret it?
        - Do they talk about sequence
          - E.g this happened, this happened
          - E.g King Died, Queen Died, Prince Died.
        - Or talk about their response and the
              cause/reason/emotion/idea evoked by the scene
          - E.g king died, then Queen died of grief because King
                died. Then Prince’s army fought terribly in battle
                due to a lack of moral, hence, they loss the war.
                The prince was shot by an arrow in the eye.
      - 2000’s pseudodebate Ludology (Gamepaly) vs Narratology
            (Story) – Ludonarritve *Harmony* vs Ludonarrative
            *Dissonance*
      - Debate
        - Game either be completely gameplay
        - Or completely story
        - Where do you fit the mechanic? (e.g Music)
        - How does the gameplay and narrative interact
- Game Narrative
  - Bad Linear Narrative
    - Story-\>Mechanics-\>Play-\>Cutscenes
      - Bad Practice present in bad AAA Games
  - Emergent Storytelling
    - Story comes from you
    - Not told in script or mechanic
      - E.g Game steamers or youtuber make up stuff about a character, for
        example when killing a soldier, the streamer/player assume that
        the soldier has a family and they will mourn for the soldier’s
        death
    - Narrative imperative
      - Something you have to do
  - What is the screen used for before Pong was created?
    - Screen are only meant for watching
  - What is screen used for after Pong was created?
    - You can now interact with the screen and control and influence the
      things in it
    - You can stuff on things on a screen as if it was a world
    - Video games you see on a screen would be an actual world
    - How to overdramatize your story and idea
      - E.g Tron Disc throw and battle disc, whoever gets hit by the
        disc dies, block it to reflect it away
        - A dramatic way to tell Pong as a story
        - Adding stakes to pong
          - If you get hit, you disintegrate
      - E.g Tron Bike Ride Race
        - Dramatizes the Snake Game, when the snake accidentally bites
          its own tail, It dies
        - Everyone’s bike leaves a trail behind, whoever gets hit by
          the trail dies
- Games Recommendation by Professor
  - Another world
  - Beyond good and evil
  - Her Story
  - Telling Lies
  - Photopia – interactive fiction
  - Journey – Music,
  - Last of Us – Child companion, escort children
  - Rhyme – weirdest atmosphere
  - Gone home
  - Edith Finch Game – Abandoned house, curse, family death backstories
    exploration, but beautiful house
  - Witcher 3
  - Shadow of colossus
  - God of War
  - Dad of War – no cutscene, or loading screen
  - East Shade – painting the view of whatever you see open world
  - Black mirror
- Video Essays
  - Charlie Brooker Game Narrative
    - Emphasizes technology is not evil, but overcoming the barrier of
      communication
