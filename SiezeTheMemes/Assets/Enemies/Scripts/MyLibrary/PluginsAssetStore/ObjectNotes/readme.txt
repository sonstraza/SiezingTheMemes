Object Labels / Notes
=====================

V2.0

How to use:

First, import the package

1 - Select an object to add a label to

2a - Select 'Object Notes > Object Note' from the 'Component' menu
2b - Or, if you want to have notes that appear in your built game, select 'Object Notes > Object Note In Game Build' from the 'Component' menu
(If you don't use the 'In Game Build' version, it won't cost any performance in your built game)

3 - Type a note and/or select an image, customize as you wish.

Note: You can move the 'ObjectNotes' folder anywhere in your folder structure.

Enjoy!
